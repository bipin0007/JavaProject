/*
 * OPPS: Object oriented Programming
 * 
 * There are mainly 4 pillars of OPPS concepts
 * 1. Inheritance - child having the property of the ancestors.
 * 2. Polymorphism
 * 3. Abstraction
 * 4. Encapsulation
 * 
 * 
 * Lets read all of the above one by one:
 * 1. Inheritance: The ultimate feature of the inheritance is reusibility of code. and avoid redundancy.
 * 
 * so lets suppose there are some similar method for ex: 5 methods which are present inside 5 classess then in that case case you will have to write the same method for 5 methods* 5 class = 25 times
 * now if suppose if there iss a line of cchange in one of the methoid then you will have to change the method for the 5 class and that can create some error 
 * so to avoid that we use inheritance.
 * 
 * use the keyword extend
 * child class object can access parent class method.
 * but parent class object can not access child class method.
 * There are 4 types of inheritance in java
 * 1. Single inheritance
 * 2. Multi level inheritance
 * 3. Multiple inheritance : cannot be achieved using class in Java.
